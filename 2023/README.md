# AOC2023

Advent of code 2023 - by Mathias JÃ¸rgensen

Completed in C++. All done by myself or with minor help from the internet.

## Not Completed

- Day 21 part 2
- Day 23 part 2

## To run

compile main.cpp with your favorite compiler (I use g++) and run the executable with the arguments:

```bash
g++ -o main main.cpp
./main.exe <day>
```
